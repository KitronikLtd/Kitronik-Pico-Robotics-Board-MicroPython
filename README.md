# Kitronik-Pico-Robotics-Board-MicroPython
A class and sample code to use the Kitronik Robotics board for Raspberry Pi Pico. (www.kitronik.co.uk/5329)

To use save PicoRobotics.py file onto the Pico so it can be imported

## Import PicoRobotics.py and construct an instance:
    import PicoRobotics
    board = PicoRobotics.KitronikPicoRobotics()

This will initialise the PCA to default values.
## Drive a motor:
    board.motorOn(motor, direction, speed)
where:
* motor => 1 to 4
* direction => f or r
* speed => 0 to 100

## Stop a motor:
    board.motorOff(motor)
where:
* motor => 1 to 4

## Drive a Servo:
    board.servoWrite(servo, degrees)
where:
* servo => 1 to 8
* degrees => 0-180

## Drive a Stepper:
    board.step(stepperMotor,direction,steps)
where:
* stepperMotor => 1 or 2 (stepper 1 is DC motors 1 and 2, stepper 2 is DC motors 3 and 4)
* direction => f or r
* steps => how many steps to make

### To step an angle:
    stepAngle(stepperMotor, direction, angle)
where
* stepperMotor => 1 or 2 (stepper 1 is DC motors 1 and 2, stepper 2 is DC motors 3 and 4)
* direction => f or r
* steps => how many steps to make

The stepper code assumes 200 steps per rev (1.8 degrees resolution) and only does full steps. 
There are defaulted parameters for stepper speeds (default 20mS pause between steps), hold position when finished stepping (off - saves energy) and how many steps per rev (200). Look at the function headers and function comments for more detail if you need to change them.

# Troubleshooting

If the code is run without the Pico Roboitcs board connected, or  if the board is not powered up it islikely that it will throw an OS Error (usually OS Error 5). 
This is because it tries to communicate with an I2C device which is not responding.

This code is designed to be used as a module. See: https://kitronik.co.uk/blogs/resources/modules-micro-python-and-the-raspberry-pi-pico for more information
